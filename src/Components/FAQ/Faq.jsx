          <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            Landwind is an open-source library of interactive components built
            on top of Tailwind CSS including buttons, dropdowns, modals,
            navbars, and more.

          <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            Landwind is first conceptualized and designed using the Figma
            software so everything you see in the library has a design
            equivalent in our Figma file.

      answer: (

          <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            The main difference is that the core components from Landwind are
            open source under the MIT license, whereas Tailwind UI is a paid
            product. Another difference is that Landwind relies on smaller and
            standalone components, whereas Tailwind UI offers sections of pages.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            However, we actually recommend using both Landwind, Landwind Pro,
            and even Tailwind UI as there is no technical reason stopping you
            from using the best of two worlds.
